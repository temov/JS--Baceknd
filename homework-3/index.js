//Events Homework
// Create an event that will greet all students when they register to our app!

//     Create a function that accepts parameters: studentFullname, studentEmail, studentPassword;
//     The function should create a new student object (PS: Feel free to add id property to the student using the uuid library from class);
//     Whenever the student object is created emit the event that will greet the student;

// BONUS:

//     The previously created event, that greets the student, should aswell save the student full name in separate file named greeting_log.txt.
//     In a separate file called students.json, using the file system module, save the newly created student.
